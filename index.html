                    <h1>WHY I CHOSE THIS SONG</h1>
                    <p>Everybody knows Ray Charles' famous hit <i>Georgia on My Mind</i>. It is a quintissential hit of early Sweet Soul music. But not many people know of the hidden
                    cultural context that lies behind the song. I chose this song because I wanted to share some of the stories of struggle and segregation behind this seemingly 
                    innocent song about a beautiful state down south, to show that even the way someone sings a song and their backgrounds can completely change the meaning
                of a song entirely.</p>

                <h1>SONG ORIGINS</h1>
                <p>The song was originally written and performed by Hoagy Carmichael. Carmichael wrote in his second biography <i>Sometimes I Wonder</i> that he was told by 
                saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer to write a song about the state of Georgia. The original arrangement of the song is a much more smoky and jazzy feel, something akin to
            what you would hear at a bar in New York City in the '30s. You can listen to the original down below.</p>

                <h1>A NEW MEANING</h1>
                <p>With Ray Charles' reimagining of the classic jazz piece in 1960, he was able to bring new meaning to the song. By furnishing the song with a more bluesy feel,
                    substituting the big band trumpet and piano for a violin ensemble and his classic crooning voice, it seems like there is a completely different meaning to the song.
                    Bringing in the cultural and racial background of '60s Georgia mixed in with Ray Charles' crooning voice makes the song much more melancholy than the original, no 
                    longer simply about a state and more about a peoples suffering in said state.
