                    <h1>WHY I CHOSE THIS SONG</h1>
                    <p>Everybody knows Ray Charles' famous hit <i>Georgia on My Mind</i>. It is a quintissential hit of early Sweet Soul music. But not many people know of the hidden
                    cultural context that lies behind the song. I chose this song because I wanted to share some of the stories of struggle and segregation behind this seemingly 
                    innocent song about a beautiful state down south, to show that even the way someone sings a song and their backgrounds can completely change the meaning
                of a song entirely. I also wanted to tell an uplifting story about the song itself, and about Ray Charles during the '60s.</p>

                    <h1>SONG ORIGINS</h1>
                    <p>The song was originally written and performed by Hoagy Carmichael. Carmichael wrote in his second biography <i>Sometimes I Wonder</i> that he was told by 
                    saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer to write a song about the state of Georgia. The original arrangement of the song is a much more smoky and jazzy feel, something akin to
                what you would hear at a bar in New York City in the '30s. You can listen to the original down below.</p>

                    <h1>A NEW MEANING</h1>
                    <p>With Ray Charles' reimagining of the classic jazz piece in 1960, he was able to bring new meaning to the song. By furnishing the song with a more bluesy feel,
                        substituting the big band trumpet and piano for a violin ensemble and his classic crooning voice, it seems like there is a completely different meaning to the song.
                        Bringing in the cultural and racial background of '60s Georgia mixed in with Ray Charles' crooning voice makes the song much more melancholy than the original, no 
                        longer simply about a state and more about a peoples suffering in said state.

                    <p style="font: 20pt Roboto Light">Georgia in the '60s was no stranger to its fair share of racism. At the time, segregation was still
                    a reality, at the time being one of the states having some of the most stringest segregation laws in the US. Home to the major organizing center of
                 Martin Luther King's Civil Rights Movement, Georgia has always been one of the critical locations for the Civil Rights Movement as a whole in America.
                 Understanding the cultural importance of this time in Georgia's history combined with the much more melancholic feel of Ray Charles' Interpretation of 
                <i>Georgia on My Mind</i> seems to add extra meaning to the song as whole.</p>

                    <p style="font: 20pt Roboto Light">In 1961, Ray Charles was set to play in Augusta, Georgia whilst the state was still in the midst of heavy segregation. 
                    Prior to his performance, activists warned him that Bell Auditorium (where he would be performing) had restricted the main floor to whites, while black people 
                would have been forced to sit in the balcony. Upon hearing this, Ray Charles refused to play. As a celebrity of the time, Ray Charles had a lot of conflict between his 
            mainstream popularity and the way he was treated as a black man in the '60s. A lot of Ray Charles' style in singing and music are derived from the musical styles of 
            his background, drawing heavily from the gospel singing of the African-American community in decades past. As a result of his refusal to play at the concert, Ray Charles was 
        fined $700 dollars. As a result of this, however, <i>Georgia on My Mind</i> became a symbol of this moment and history, and forever became a symbol of Ray Charles' contribution 
    to the Civil Rights Movement; cementing his place as a figurehead in the African-American community and in the fight for civil rights. Ray Charles went on to say in 1975, quote 
    ‘It’s a very sad thing for a country like the United States. It’s the most abject thing I had to live with growing up in the South. 
    The most terrible thing was not being able to go where I wanted to go, not being able to eat where I wanted to eat.’ In 1979, Georgia went on to apologize to Ray Charles, making his rendition
 of <i>Georgia on My Mind</i> the official state anthem.</p>
